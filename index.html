    <h1>Hi, I'm Peter</h1>
    <p>I am based in NYC. I like technology, products, and people. I've spent most of my time on backend, platform, and infra teams.
        <br/>        <br/>

        I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.withmoment.com/"">Moment</a>. I've worked at/founded a few other companies before - mostly fintech or consumer.
        <br />        <br/>
