    <h1>Hi, I'm Peter</h1>
    <p>I am based in NYC. I really care about technology and people.
        <br/><br/>
        I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.withmoment.com/"">Moment</a>. 
        <br/><br/>
        I've founded & worked at a few other companies before - mostly fintech or consumer.
